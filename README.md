Project #2: Calculator

This is my calculator made using p5.js. You may use the keyboard or click on the screen to enter numbers and operators. Order of operations is maintained! Use the spacebar/backspace to clear the screen. Use the enter key to calculate the value of the expression you entered. 

I created this project because I enjoy math and thought it would be fun to create a basic calculator from scratch. I also did my best to make it look nice/colorful.

I made this program using p5.js and made it usable on web using an index.html file. I used CSS to style the non-canvas part. In the javascript file, I incorporated RGB/hex colors, variables, loops, arrays, keys, mousePressed, and more funcitons to make my webpage aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly.

The biggest challenge I had was performing the operation(s) from the array. I was able to solve it by creating loops and condition statements to utilize the order of operations.

I learned how to link javascript files to make it visible on web and how to organize code into different functions. I also learned how variables in p5.js are different from those of javascript/Java/C.
